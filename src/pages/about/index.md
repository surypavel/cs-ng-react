      We offer a small, but carefully curated selection of brewing gear and
      tools for every taste and experience level. No matter if you roast your
      own beans or just bought your first french press, you’ll find a gadget
      to fall in love with in our shop.

      Love a great cup of coffee, but never knew how to make one? Bought a
      fancy new Chemex but have no clue how to use it? Don't worry, we’re here
      to help. You can schedule a custom 1-on-1 consultation with our baristas
      to learn anything you want to know about coffee roasting and brewing.

      We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
      That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
      space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
      coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
      sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

### Jsme Tereza, Petra a Anna – tři kamarádky a učitelky češtiny.

Potkaly jsme se na vysoké škole a i po ní jsme se nadále vídaly jako kolegyně v jedné neziskové organizaci. Protože jsme spolu vždy trávily rády čas v práci i mimo ni, rozhodly jsme si založit společný projekt – Češtinu v pohodě.
